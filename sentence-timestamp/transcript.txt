Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's fourth quarter 2024 Q&A webcast. My name is Travis Axelrod, the Head of Investor Relations at Tesla, and I am joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and several other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at 3 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent SEC filings.
During the Q&A portion, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Use the raise hand button to join the question queue. Before we begin Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.
Elon Musk:
In Q4, we set a record, delivering vehicles at an annualized rate of nearly 2 million per year. Congratulations to the Tesla team on achieving record production and deliveries. Model Y was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in 2024—not just the best electric vehicle, but the best vehicle overall.
We remain focused on maximizing volumes and advancing autonomy. In 2024, we made critical investments in manufacturing, AI, and robotics that will yield immense benefits in the future. I see a path, though not an easy one, for Tesla to become the most valuable company in the world by far. There is a potential scenario where Tesla is worth more than the next top five companies combined, primarily due to autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.
We laid the groundwork for this in 2024 and will continue in 2025, setting up for what I predict will be an epic 2026 and an even more significant 2027 and 2028. Many do not yet grasp the value of full self-driving (FSD) and our ability to monetize the fleet. Some have compared my past optimism to the "boy who cried wolf," but this time, the reality of autonomy is upon us.
A typical passenger car has about 10 hours of utility per week out of 168. Once autonomous, that increases to at least 50-55 hours per week. These vehicles can be used for passenger and package delivery at all hours, dramatically increasing their value. This could be the largest asset value increase in human history.
FSD Version 13 has shown significant improvement, and Version 14 will be another major step forward. We launched the Cortex training cluster at Gigafactory Austin, a key contributor to FSD advancement, and we continue to invest in AI training infrastructure.
Optimus, our humanoid robot, will require at least 10 times the AI training compute of our vehicles due to its broader range of applications. Long-term, Optimus has the potential to generate over $10 trillion in revenue. Even a $500 billion investment in AI training would be justified in that scenario.
In June, we plan to launch unsupervised FSD as a paid service in Austin. We already have Teslas operating autonomously at our Fremont factory, and they will soon do the same at our Texas factory. By mid-year, Teslas will be driving autonomously in the real world.
On the energy side, our grid storage solutions will play a crucial role in enhancing energy output. Our second factory in Shanghai is coming online, and we are building a third factory to meet growing demand.
Vaibhav Taneja:
In Q4, we set records in vehicle deliveries and energy storage deployments. Despite a challenging macro environment, we grew auto and energy storage volumes sequentially and year-over-year. We reduced inventory levels, ending the quarter with the lowest finished goods inventory in two years, aided by financing options and other programs.
Automotive margins declined due to lower ASPs and FSD revenue recognition in Q3. However, we reduced our cost per car below $35,000, driven primarily by material cost savings. This was achieved despite increased depreciation as we prepare for the new Model Y, which begins production in all factories next month. This transition will result in lost production weeks, temporarily impacting margins, but will improve over time.
We remain on track to launch a more affordable model in early 2025, continuing to expand our lineup. Our energy storage business is growing rapidly, with deployments expected to increase at least 50% year-over-year in 2025.
Operating expenses increased, primarily due to R&D investments in AI. Free cash flow for Q4 was $2 billion, with $3.6 billion generated for the year. We remain focused on capital efficiency, targeting AI investments for immediate benefits.
Investor Q&A:
Q: Is unsupervised FSD still planned for Texas and California this year? What hurdles remain?
Musk: Yes, we are confident it will launch in Texas in June and expand to California later this year. We expect to roll out unsupervised FSD in multiple U.S. regions by year-end. The primary constraint is safety validation to ensure it significantly exceeds human driving capabilities.
Q: Are there discussions with other automakers about licensing FSD?
Musk: Yes, several major automakers have expressed significant interest. We recommend they analyze our vehicle architecture to understand FSD integration. Licensing will be considered for high-volume deals.
Q: What is the timeline for selling Optimus robots externally?
Musk: In 2024, Optimus will be used internally at Tesla to handle repetitive factory tasks. Version 2 production will begin in 2025, and external sales could start in the second half of the year. Production is expected to scale exponentially, reaching over a million units annually at a production cost below $20,000.
Q: What is the status of Tesla Semi production?
Taneja: We recently completed the Semi factory roof and walls in Reno. Initial high-volume builds are expected late 2025, with ramp-up in 2026. Semi’s value will significantly increase with autonomy.
Q: Will Tesla need to upgrade Hardware 3 vehicles?
Musk: Yes, Hardware 3 owners who purchased FSD will require an upgrade. This will be challenging but necessary.
Q: What technical improvements define FSD Version 14?
Tesla AI Team: We are scaling model size, increasing context length, and refining reinforcement learning. Future updates will incorporate audio data and further enhance corner case handling.
Q: How will battery constraints impact vehicle production in 2025?
Musk: Battery production is our primary constraint. We are working on increasing total gigawatt-hour output.
Closing Remarks:
2025 will be a pivotal year for Tesla. The launch of unsupervised FSD and advancements in real-world AI will make it one of the most significant years in company history. No other company is as advanced in real-world AI as Tesla, and we are poised to redefine the industry.
