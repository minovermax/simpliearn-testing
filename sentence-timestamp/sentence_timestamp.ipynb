      "Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Teslas. Fourth quarter, 2024 Cuban a webcast. My name is Travis, Axelrod investor relations and a number of other executives. Are Q4 results were announced at about 3 p.m. central Time in the update deck be published at the same length as a business Outlook. And make forward-looking statements are based on our predictions and expectations as of today, actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned our most recent filings with the SEC.  During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the phrase hand button to join the question to you. Before we jump in. The Q&A Elan has some marks on an annualised rate of a year except work retrieving record production and deliveries electrical the best vehicle of any kind on Earth. Another one with Spotify on volume four,  It was really fun of me, but really it's like animes like 10 Xing likely doubling is not even enough sense. In 2024 in manufacturing in robotics that will be immense fruit in the future and meds like it's in fact that such a scale that it is difficult to comprehend this before and I'll stand by it. I see a path far not even close so I can maybe several times more than  I mean, there is a passport, Elsa is worth more than the next top five companies combined. There's a pastor that  Are you going to cry like a difficult path? But it is.  So,  internet is overwhelmingly due to Economist vehicles and autonomous humanoid robots.  So, our focus is it is actually building towards.  And then. That's why we're laying the ground. We related on work for that in. 2024 will continue to lay the groundwork for that in 2025. Actually, we're pulling the manufacturing lines and  I'd like it's setting up for what I think will be an epic 20-26 and a ridiculous 27 and 28, ridiculously good.  That is my prediction.  And a few people understand the value of. Driving in our belated, Matt, Montes. The fleet people said that if it's like me and it's like meeting someone when they're like a toddler and thinking that there would be a toddler forever but I definitely was a toddler and that's really what we got.  And it took up to for people to understand this because you need to worship is linear as opposed to what we're seeing is exponential progress. So  That's why I went to one recommendation for anyone who doubts. This is simply try it. Have you tried it? When's the last time you try to tend the only people who are skeptical, only people are skeptical about tractors.  So let me know a car goes passenger car typically has only about 10 hours of Belleview utilities per week out of 168.  Very small percentage. Once that cars of Thomas, my rough estimate is that it is is in use for at least a third of the hours, 55 hours of the week and people's packages in the mail tonight we'll resupply restaurants or whatever the case may be. Why do people need at all hours of the day or night already exist?  With no income middle class. Change just a software update. Now have five times or more. Utility does Carly have  I am I think this will be the largest asset value increase in human history. Maybe there's something bigger but I'm I just don't know what it is.  And so people who would look in the rear-view mirror people past president except I don't think there is one. So  Yeah, that does Derrick Rose.  And I repeat my advice.  Try dragging the car.  I'll let it drive you.  So now if it works very well in the US,\n",
