      "Sentence 14: That's worth noting that not just the best electric vehicle, the best vehicle of any kind on Earth.\n",
      "Sentence 15: Number one, whereas model, y,  we're staying focused on maximizing volumes and obviously doubling down, or  I don't know what.\n",
      "Sentence 16: Really does it.\n",
      "Sentence 17: I was going to doubling down autonomy, but really it's like autonomy is like 10x and frankly doubling is not even enough.\n",
      "Sentence 18: We made many critical investments in 2024 in manufacturing, Ai and Robotics that will bear immense fruit in the future and meds like it's in fact to such a scale that it is difficult to comprehend.\n",

      "Sentence 23: I mean, I think it's like  an incredibly just like a difficult path but it is an achievable path.\n",
      "Sentence 24: so,  And that is overwhelmingly due to autonomous vehicles and autonomous humanoid robots.\n",

      "Sentence 42: It's like walks and talks and that's really what we've got.\n",
      "Sentence 43: And it's typical to, for people to understand just because human intuition is linear as to what we're seeing is exponential progress.\n",
      "Sentence 44: So,  That's why my one recommendation for anyone who doubts, is simply try it.\n",
      "Sentence 45: Have you tried it?\n",

      "Sentence 50: once that car is autonomous,  My rough estimate is that it is, you is in use, for at least a third of the hours per week, so call it 50, maybe 35 hours of the week.\n",
      "Sentence 51: And it can be useful for both cargo delivery and people delivery.\n",
      "Sentence 52: So even let's say people are asleep, but you can deliver packages in the middle of the night or resupply restaurants or whatever the case may be, whatever.\n",
      "Sentence 53: People need at all hours of the day overnight.\n",
      "Sentence 54: That same asset, the thing that that is these things that already exist.\n",

      "Sentence 62: and so people who look in the rearview, mirror are looking for past present, except I don't think there is one  so,  but, you know, that there  but the reality autonomy is upon us.\n",
      "Sentence 63: And I repeat my advice.\n",
      "Sentence 64: Try driving the car.\n",
      "Sentence 65: Or let it dry View.\n",
      "Sentence 66: So now it works very well in the US.\n",
      "Sentence 67: But of course it will over time work just as well everywhere else.\n",
      "Sentence 68: Yeah.\n",
      "Sentence 69: so,  We're working hard to grow our annual volumes.\n",
      "Sentence 70: I've constraint this.\n",
      "Sentence 71: Our current constraint is battery packs this year, but we're working on addressing best constraint.\n",

      "Sentence 73: and then,  Things are really going to go ballistic next year.\n",
      "Sentence 74: And  Really blessing in 2017 and 28.\n",
      "Sentence 75: So,  Yeah.\n",
      "Sentence 76: So, a bit more on full self-driving.\n",
      "Sentence 77: Our Q4 Vehicle Safety report shows continued year over year, Improvement in safety for vehicles.\n",

      "Sentence 79: The safety difference is our gigantic.\n",
      "Sentence 80: So,  And people have seen the immense improvement with version 13 and with incremental versions and version 13 and it was 14 is going to be yet another Step Beyond that.\n",
      "Sentence 81: That is very significant.\n",
      "Sentence 82: We launched the cortex training cluster at gigafactory Austin which was a significant contributor to FSD advancement.\n",
      "Sentence 83: And continue to invest in training infrastructure out of Texas headquarters  so the training needs for Optimus are, Optimus humanoid robot, I'll probably at least ultimately 10x  what what's needed for the car at least to get to the full range of  useful roles, you can selling, if how many different roles are there for a humanoid, robot versus a car,  here at robot is  has probably well 1000.\n",
      "Sentence 84: Times more uses and we'll complex things then.\n",
      "Sentence 85: in a car, that doesn't mean the training scales by 1,000, but  It's probably.\n",
      "Sentence 86: You know, 10x now you can do this progressively so it doesn't mean like hotels are going to spend like 500 billion dollars in training commute.\n",

      "Sentence 88: To do enough tasks.\n",
      "Sentence 89: To match the output of Optimus robots.\n",
      "Sentence 90: But, and I was the cost of training is dropping dramatically with time.\n",
