      "Sentence 10: So, congratulations to the Tesla team on.\n",
      "Sentence 11: Excellent work.\n",
      "Sentence 12: We're to achieving record production and deliveries we  Wonder why was the best-selling vehicle cost of any kind for 2024?\n",
      "Sentence 13: That's worth noting that the not just the best electric vehicle, the best vehicle of any kind on Earth.\n",
      "Sentence 14: Number one, where's Lorelai?\n",
      "Sentence 15: We're staying focused on maximizing volumes and obviously doubling down for, I don't know what really does, it essentially doubling down on autonomy, but really, it's like autonomy is like ten Xing frankly, doubling is not even enough room.\n",

      "Sentence 53: So we're working hard to grow our annual volumes.\n",
      "Sentence 54: I've been straight this, your current constraint is battery packs this year, but we were working on addressing that constraint  And I think we will make progress in addressing that constraint and then things are really going to go ballistic next year and really Bliss again 27 and 28.\n",

      "Sentence 69: We're gonna spend You know 10x that now you can do this progressively.\n",
      "Sentence 70: So doesn't mean like or Tesla going to spend like five hundred billion dollars in training compute?\n",
      "Sentence 71: Because we were obviously trained The Optimist to do enough tasks to match the output of autonomous robots.\n",
      "Sentence 72: and obviously the cost of training is dropping dramatically with time so but it is it is  Like is one of those things where I think long-term Optimus will be.\n",
      "Sentence 73: At what Optimus has the potential to be north of 10 trillion dollars in Revenue, like it's really bananas.\n",
      "Sentence 74: So that your cautiously forward, a lot of training computer in that situation.\n",
      "Sentence 75: In fact, even 500 billion dollars training computer in that situation will require your deal.\n",
      "Sentence 76: Yeah.\n",

      "Sentence 82: No one in the car for self-driving, in Austin, in June, we already have a Tesla.\n",
      "Sentence 83: Has operating autonomously on two wires for so, driving at our Factory in Fremont and will soon be a free bird during that, at our Factory in Texas?\n",
      "Sentence 84: So thousands of cars every day are driving with no one in them and on Fremont, Factory in California, they will soon be during that and Austin and then elsewhere in the world for the rest of our factories, which is pretty cool.\n",
      "Sentence 85: And the cars aren't just  driving to exactly the same spot because obviously at all when it's light at the same spot hey the cars are actually programmed with with where with what Lane then you talked into to be picked up for delivery.\n",
      "Sentence 86: So they're drive from the factory End of Line to their specific to their destination, parking spot and and the foot could be picked up for delivery to customers.\n",
